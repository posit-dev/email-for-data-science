    "text": "In this tutorial, we are going to send an email from a Gmail account. To do so, you will need to create an App Password. Note this is only possible if you’ve enabled 2-step verification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is just one of many options: it is also possible to send emails in Python from other email providers (Outlook, ProtonMail, etc.), or even from a custom domain. To skip ahead to a discussion of alternative sending methods, see Authentication\n\n\nOnce you’ve created your App Password, that is used as your Gmail password for sending with Python.\nThere are many ways to store the password seperate from your email-sending code, so as to not expose any sensitive information. One such appraoch uses a .env file, and the `dotenv and os packages.\n\n\n.env\n\nGMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcd abcd abcd abcd\n\n\n\nmain.py\n\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nyour_gmail_address = \"YourGmail@gmail.com\"\ngmail_app_password = os.environ[\"GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD\"]\n\nCheck out the email content we will send.\n\nAnd now we send the email!\n\nimport redmail\n\nredmail.gmail.username = your_gmail_address\nredmail.gmail.password = gmail_app_password\n\nredmail.gmail.send(\n    subject=\"An Example Email\",\n    receivers=[username],\n    html=email_html,\n    text=email_plaintext,\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Subject: An Example Email\n    From: YourGmail@gmail.com\n    To: Recipient@gmail.com\n    Date: Tue, 07 Oct 2025 20:27:53 -0000\n  \n  \n    \nFor a number of decades in the middle of the 20th century, the nature of the soccer ball changed quite drastically in each iteration of the World Cup.
